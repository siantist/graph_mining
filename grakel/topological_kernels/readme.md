Graph NNs in processing relational data with graphs (encode pairwise relations)

In TDL (topological deep learning), data are features defined on discrete domains such as
- sets: collections of points called nodes
- graphs

Beyond graphs: domains
- set + pairwise relations (graph)
- set + part-whole relations (simplicial complex, cellular complex)
- set + set-type relations (hypergraph)
- set + part-whole and set-type relations (combinatorial complex)
