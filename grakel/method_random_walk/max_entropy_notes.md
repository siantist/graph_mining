To do: relate the weight matrix (and the stationary dist) with the Laplacian (?)
$\Omega_{ij} = A_{ij} \frac{ e_i}{ \chi e_j}$ and $P_i^{\infty} = e_i^2$

convergence of random walk depends on the gap between the first and second eigenvalues

pg 16 can modify the weights and improve convergence bound
pg 12 For function $f: V \rightarrow R$, we have $L f(x) = \sum_{ y, x ~y } ( f(x) - f(y) ) w(x,y)$

qn: what does lazy random walk do?
